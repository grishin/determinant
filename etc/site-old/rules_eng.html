					<P>Matrix game is an absolutely new kind of math logical games. I bet you've never 
						seen anything like that neither on PocketPC nor on any other platform. Hope 
						you'll like this game. To play Matrix Game you won't need some superhuman math 
						knowledge. A common school education will be enough to play and to win. Also 
						all information needed will be given below.
					</P>
					<H3>How to Play.</H3>
					<P>A common matrix is a table of m collumns and n rows. In our case m = n = 3, so 
						we have a table 3x3. In any cell a digit from 1 to 9 can be input. Once you've 
						done that you can't use anymore neiser this digit nor this cell. In the game 
						two players input digits in cells one by one.&nbsp; A determinat isanumber that 
						characterizes the current posotion of numbers in matrix. It can be both 
						positive and negative. The goal for one player is to get the highest matrix 
						determinant. He is called "Positive Player" or "P+". The goal for another one 
						is to to get the lowest possible deternminant. He is called "Negative Player" 
						or "N-".&nbsp;
						<H3>How To Win.</H3>
					<P>To win you need to know the rules of counting a determinant.
					</P>
					<P>In&nbsp; matrix there are&nbsp;some groups of cells, three for one player, three 
						for another. To&nbsp;count a determinant you need to multiply three numbers in 
						all groops, then sum the results. A determinant is a difference between a 
						number that P+ got and the number of P-.&nbsp;</P>
					<P>Examine the groops for each player.</P>

					<P>As you see the groups are symmetrical, so it is easy to learn them.</P>
					<P>So to win you need to&nbsp;get higher numbers in you groups than in your 
						opponent's groups. How to do it? The strategy is yours.</P>
